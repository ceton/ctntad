ctntad is an implementation of the Tuning Adapter <-> MOCUR Service for the
Ceton InfiniTV on linux. It could also run on OSX or Windows, if the
library dependencies were met. It depends on gupnp and gusb.

Currently it requires a custom gusb library available here:
http://cetoncorp.com/downloads/libgusb-0.1.4.tar.xz

Follow the following steps for first libgusb, then ctntad:
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make install (as root)

This will install /usr/bin/ctntad which must be run as root currently. It will
automatically pair any found TA's and InfiniTVs.
