ctntad is an implementation of the Tuning Adapter service for the Ceton InfiniTV to
support Switch Digital Video on linux

Currently it requires git HEAD of gusb, or you can download a known working
tarball here: http://cetoncorp.com/downloads/libgusb-0.1.4.tar.xz

Follow the following steps for first libgusb, then ctntad:
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make install (as root)

This will install /usr/bin/ctntad which must be run as root currently. It will
automatically pair any found TA's and InfiniTVs.


Ubuntu Dependencies

apt install libtool autoconf automake make
apt install libgupnp-1.2-dev
apt install libgusb-dev
