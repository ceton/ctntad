ctntad is an implementation of the Tuning Adapter <-> MOCUR Service for the
Ceton InfiniTV on linux. It could also run on darwin or windows, if the
library dependencies were met. It depends on gupnp and gusb.

To build from a fresh clone run:
autoreconf -i
./configure
make

Successive updates should generally only require running make
